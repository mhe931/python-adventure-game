Generate a complete Python project structure and all necessary files for a collaborative, open-source, text-based "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. The project should be specifically designed for a beginner-level programming class, making it easy for students to add their own story sections.
The project must be highly Pythonic, with clean, readable, and well-commented code.
The generated files should include:

main.py: A central Python script that handles the core game logic. This script should read story content from separate files, present the user with choices, and navigate the story's branching paths. It must be robust enough to handle basic user input errors.

story/: A subdirectory containing the individual story files. These files should be in a simple, standardized format (e.g., Markdown or plain text) that is easy for a beginner to write. Each file should contain the story text and a clear list of numbered choices, with each choice pointing to the filename of the next story section.

README.md: A welcoming and professional project description. It should explain the game, its purpose as a learning tool, and most importantly, provide a clear, step-by-step guide for new contributors on how to play and how to get started with contributing.

CONTRIBUTING.md: A detailed guide for students on the open-source workflow. This file must use simple, direct language to explain the process of forking the repository, cloning it, adding a new story section, and submitting a pull request via GitHub. It should also specify the exact file naming convention and story-part format.
The overall project structure and documentation should prioritize simplicity, collaboration, and scalability, allowing a large number of students to easily contribute to a single, shared narrative.
