# Choose Your Own Adventure (Beginner Project)

Welcome to the **Choose Your Own Adventure** project!  
This is a collaborative, text-based storytelling game written in Python.  

## ðŸŽ® How It Works
- The story is divided into small sections, each stored as a text file inside the `story/` folder.
- Each file contains:
  - Story text
  - A numbered list of choices
  - Each choice leads to another file (branch in the story).
- Players run the game with `python main.py` and navigate by entering numbers.

## ðŸŒ± Purpose
This project is designed for **beginner programmers** to practice:
- Reading and writing Python code
- Working with text files
- Collaborating on an open-source project

## ðŸš€ How to Play
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts and enjoy the story!
