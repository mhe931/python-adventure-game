Title: Accept the dragon's mysterious offer
"I am old," the dragon continues, "and tired of guarding this treasure alone. I seek someone worthy to share in its secrets. You may take one handful of treasure, but more importantly, I will teach you the ancient magic of the crystals."

The dragon gestures with one massive claw toward the glowing walls. "These crystals hold the power to light the way for lost travelers, to heal wounds, and to bring good fortune to those pure of heart."

"Will you accept my gift and become a guardian of the light?"

You realize this is more than treasure - this is the beginning of a magical destiny you never imagined possible.

Congratulations! You have discovered one of the secret magical endings!
