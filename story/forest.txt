Title: Enter the dark forest
You decide to brave the mysterious forest. As you walk along the winding path, the trees grow thicker and the light grows dim. Strange sounds echo from deeper in the woods - hooting owls, rustling leaves, and something else... something larger.

After walking for what feels like hours, you come across a fork in the path. To your left, you notice a faint glow coming from what appears to be a cave entrance. To your right, the path continues deeper into the forest where you can hear the distant sound of running water.

What will you do?
